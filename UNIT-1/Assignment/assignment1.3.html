<!--The function of the HTML <img> tag is to embed an image into a web page.

Unlike most HTML elements,
the <img> tag is a 
self-closing, or void, element, meaning it doesn't have a seperate closing tag(</img>).
It simply points to an external image files and places it at that posotion in the document.
Essential Attributes and their Importance
````````````````````
The <img> tag requires certain attributes to function correctly and efficiently:

1. src(source)
Function: Specifies the path (URL or file location) of the image file that the browser should display.
Importance: This is the most crucial attribute as it tells the browser which image to load. Without a validsrc value.
the browser cannot display an image. The path can be relative (e.g., "logo.png") or absolute 
(e.g., "https://example.com/images/logo.png").

2. alt (alternate text)
Function: Provides a short, descriptive text alternative for the image.-->
